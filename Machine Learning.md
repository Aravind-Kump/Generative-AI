# Machine Learning
  Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## Machine learning algorithms
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

### Supervised Learning
Learns for being given 'right answers'. 
Learn from data labeled with 'right answers'.

Uses Regression to predict a number/output.

| Input(X)      |          Output(Y)    |     Application       |
|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| email         |      spam?(0/1)       |  Spam filtering       | 
| audio         |      text translation |  Speech recognition   |
| English       |      spanish          |  machine translation  |
| ad, user info |      click? (0/1)     |  online advertising   |
| image, radar info |  postion of other cars | Self driving car |
| image of phone |     defect? (0/1)    |  visual inspection    |

Regression
Predict a number infintely many possible outputs 

Classification 
Predict catefories small number of possible outputs.

### Unsupervised Learning
Find something interesting in unlabeled data.
