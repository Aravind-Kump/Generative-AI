# Generative-AI

## AI != ML

# AI :
Is a theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. 

# ML:
Is a subfield of AI
ML gives computer the ability to learn without explicit programming. 

   Models in ML:
       1. Unsupervised ML models
       2. Supervised ML models

- In supervised learning we are learning from past examples to predict future values.

- Unsupervised problems are all about looking at the raw data, and seeing if it naturally falls into groups.

# Deep Learning:
Deep learning use Artificial Neural Networks - allowing them to process more complex patterns than traditional machine learning. (Semi supervises models)

# Generative AI:
Generative AI is a subset of Deep learning.
Large Languaged Models(LLMs) are also a subset of Deep Learning.

## Deep Learning Model Types:
       1. Discriminative
         - Used to classify or predict
         - Typically trained on a dataset of labeled data
         - Learns the relationship between the features of the data points and the labels

         
       2. Generative
         - Generates new data that is similar to data it was trained on
         - Understands distribution of data and how likely a given example is
         - Predict next word in a sequence

- GenAI is a type of AI that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content.
- The process of learning from existing content is called training and results in the creation of a statistical model.
- When given a prompt, GenAI uses this statistical model to predict what an expected response might be and this generates new content.

## Generative Models
   1. Generative 'Language' models  -- Learn about patterns in language through training data. Given some text, they predict what comes next.
   2. Generative 'Image' models  -- Produce new images using techniques like diffusion. Given a prompt or related imagery, they transform random noise into images or generate images from prompts.
